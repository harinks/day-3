3.What is the difference between window, screen and document in javascript


>window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript

>document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML

>screen describes the physical display's full screen


in the simply words, 

screen is full display of the system or physical device.
window is the browser application window with or without the content.
document is the document of HTML document with properties and frames


window properties include:

>setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer
>location giving the current URL
>history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history
>navigator describing the browser software


document:

Each window object has a document object to be rendered. 
These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id.

<body>
  <p id="demo"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
</body>

the paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:

window.demo or window["demo"]
document.getElementById("demo")
document.querySelector("#demo")
document.body.demo
document.body.array[0]


Screen:

The window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:

>screen properties width and height are the full screen
>screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
